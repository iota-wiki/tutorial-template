## State the Goal

Your tutorial should state a clear goal the users will achieve. You should focus on a concrete task they will fulfill
rather than what you want the to learn.

**Example**: `In this tutorial, you will set up a node using docker`.

## Prerequisites

You should let the users know about any hardware, software or prior knowledge they should have right from the start.
This can save the users from being frustrated with errors because they are missing X package, or have a different setup
than what you tested.

This is where you should add tools, package manager or similar things that you used here, together with their version.

## Set Up

You should describe any steps required to get the user started.

## Run

You should provide all the steps the user will need to follow to achieve the [goal](#state-the-goal). You should only
describe a single happy path, leaving no room for ambiguity. Make sure you describe every single step and that each
step works every time.

* `First, do X. After the X process has finished, do Y.`
* `Notice that, notice how, remember that.`

Make sure let the users know what to expect each step of the way, as well as when they have achieved the goal.

* `Once you have run X the output should look like the following:`
* `You have set up X using Y.`

If you need to explain something, don't go into detail, add a link if you need to.

* `You must always do X before Y because ... (see Explanation for more details)`
