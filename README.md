# tutorial-template

This README will walk you through setting up a tutorial for the Wiki. You can replace this README with your own content after going through the steps.

# Documentation

Add your tutorial documentation to the `template.md` file. Try to follow the provided layout by listening the tools (with version) you used, explainingy how to setup and run the application. If you need more then one page you need to add the files to `sidebar.js`.

# Gitpod

This template also includes a gitpod config file: `gitpod.yml`. Using this will help users test your tutorial with one click. If you are not going to use it, you can just delete it.
The basic setup is to provide a command for `init` which will be executed while the gitpod workspace launches (can be used to install dependencies for example), provide a startup `command` and configure `ports` if needed.
